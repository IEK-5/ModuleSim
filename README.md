ModuleSim
=========

GNU Octave script to be used together with SourceField to model the impact of defects on thin-film solar modules.

This script depends on the SourceField program (also on github). It uses this program to model the impact of 
local defects and sheet resistance on the performance of cells within a thin-film solar module.

As the paper is currently under review I will upload the code once it is through :)
